 * 16. 3Sum Closest
 *
 * Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
 * Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
 *
 * The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 *
 * 题意：
 * 从数组中找到3个数，这3个数相加的值需要离目标值最近
 *
 * 思路：
 *
